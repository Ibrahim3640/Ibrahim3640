# Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

My name is Ibrahim Sajid and I currently study in Leeds beckett University. I am a 2nd year student who loves to programme and scratch my head trying to solve a problem. I have experience in Java, Python and dabbled upon SQL. All language which I enjoy to programme. Even though my attention span for reading books is minimum, there is something about unicorn and pheonix project books that I enjoy. They are like religious manuscripts that everyone should hold if they want to have a grasp at the broad field of IT.

## About me

At the moment, I am studying Java, Python, Django, html, css, R (machine learning), C/C++ (arduino), SQL.

These are the programming languages that I carry on learning as they require time and experience. However, the one language that you may be surprised that excited me is C/C++. Even thought it is very difficult and it is the parent of all programming languages, It is the arduino that I have been experimenting with. The reason why I have an interest towards arduino came from when I was 13 years old who was repairing ps4 controllers. This means I love electronics and trying to fix them up.

I have always been curious of how the digital world is created by software systems from the user interface of people interacting systems all the way to the codes that are the reason for the digital world. Additionally, I aspire to be the best software engineer who leanrns principles and ensure to have the best of ability in the problem solving world.
